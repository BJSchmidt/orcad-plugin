// The chunk the page fetches when the 3D view is first needed. It is built on
// its own (vite.viewport.config.js) so it stays out of the page OrcaSlicer loads
// with SetPage(), and it registers itself on window for the app to pick up.
//
// Only the classes Viewport.jsx uses are imported, so three.js tree-shakes
// instead of shipping every export.
